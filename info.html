<h1>Band Info</h1>
<br>
<p class="welp"><em>Mass Necrosis</em> is a small Metal project started in August 2023 by two brothers from Virginia. The members of <em>Mass Necrosis</em>- Jonathan (Guitar, Drums, and Vocals) and Timothy Brady (Bass, Backing Vocals) -strive to create music that captures an aggressive yet intriguing sound. After their 2024 release <em>Cold Stee</em>l the band decided to continue looking into different Metal subgenres. This culminated with the gritty August EP <em>Broken Ties</em>. From here the band intends to expand on lyrical topics while experimenting with OSDM and Punk aesthetics.</p>

<tr><td><img src="Album_1.png" width="800px"></td><td><p>The band's first album, <em>Cold Steel</em>, was a first attempt at home recording and an amateur debut. This album is primarily influenced by a combination of Thrash Metal, Metalcore, and Deathcore. Despite the apparent variety in influences this album is consistently Heavy Metal throught and through.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="Broken Ties.png" width="800px"></td><td><p><em>Broken Ties</em> was a the follow up EP that came out later the same year. This time the DIY nature of the production was leaned in on and elaborated on with more experimentation and a far more raw sound. There's everything from Unblack Metal to Pop influence on this album with better produced choruses yet far heavier and faster riffage.</p></td></tr>
